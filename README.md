# Design-Single-Cycle-processor.


Designed single-cycle processor with arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MULT, NAND) and memory (LOAD, STORE) operations.<br>
Used 32-register file, 32-bit instructions, and program memory(block ram) with program counter.<br>
ALU operations are selected based on Opcode and results are stored back into the register file.<br>
-Supported LOAD (LW) and STORE (SW) instructions for memory transactions, adhering to RISC architecture principles.<br>
